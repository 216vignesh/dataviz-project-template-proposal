# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is New York City air quality surveillance data. Air pollution is one of the most important environmental threat and many people are exposed to bad quality air every now and then. Exposures to common air pollutants have been a cause of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and premature deaths. The indicators in the dataset provide a perspective across time and regions in NYC to characterize air quality and health in the city.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * How do NO2 levels vary across different regions over time?
   We need to explore spatial and temporal trends in air quality data, focusing on NO2 levels for various areas
 * Can users compare NO2 level across different regions within a specific timeframe?
   Task is to enable users to select regions on map and visualize NO2 or other parameters over the period.
 * What is the impact of selecting different air quality criteria?
   The task is to explore how the choice of criteria influences the understanding of air quality in different areas.
 * How user-friendly and intuitive is the interactive visualization for non-expert users?
   This task focuses on assessing the usability of the interactive visualization, ensuring that it is accessible to all.

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)


## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a bar chart and it shows top 5 regions with high NO2 levels. Also I have added new techniques to it like adding legends, color of the bar according to the values, hovering over to get the values, etc.

(please put a screenshot of one or more visualizations of this dataset you already made, for previous assignments, and link to them)

You can put images into here by pasting them into issues.

You can make images into links like this:

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)

## Milestones

(for each week, estimate what would be accomplised)
